times, knowing that i will be fine as long as i have you. often before bed, i always tell myself all is good as we have one anothers' hearts. you hold mine as i hold yours. and if i were 
to be honest, the quote on my tatsumaki bot wasn't really even meant for you at first... but now i've found you.. i think.. it was meant for you since you are far away three THOUSAND miles
and that's a lot i guess that explains your name.. 'milesaway' anyway! you are an amazing amazing loving person who is super positive even through the most negative times and it's amazing
what you've been through and how you are able to recover. ah :') you leave me so happy aghghghgh i want to hug you so much much much much with your peaceful and amazing presence. i dont 
know what the future holds for us but it'll be how it goes. i hope we can stay forever and forever :33 and i look forward to meeting you one day :')
